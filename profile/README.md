## Welcome to Messy Void Studios

An indie studio prioritising the creation of minimal, quality content for the **Messy Void Universe**.

All repositories will remain under **[Scott's profile](https://github.com/artdoesstuff)**, as this will serve as a studio front for the games created until future _collaborators_ are invited into **Messy Void Studios** to aid in development.

### What is the Messy Void Universe?

The **Messy Void Universe** is a collection of interconnected experiences, connecting genres from the incremental and tower defence spaces, to existential and psychological horror.
Each game you play through is a piece of a larger puzzle, _do you think you can figure it out?_.

### Project Information

The **Messy Void Universe's** projects will be executed in *Batches* with their own *Phases*. Each *Batch* will focus on its own collection of games, with each *Phase* slowly twisting the story until it reaches its end.

As of January 2026, we are on Batch 0, Phase 1. If you are curious how the universe's timeline will play out, click **[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wa7GJMd-CLkKVVGESJYbVKu8QDYZHxdH1hmS51cafoE/)**.

All projects will be built with C++17/20 and SFML 3.
